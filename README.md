# Covid-19-Project
H.Dip. Data Analytics

Group project for the R for Data Analytics module in Semester 1.

The group was given a set of publicly available data on Coivd cases in Ireland, with additional information on individual county statistics. The primary aim of the project was to come up with our own research questions appropriate for the data, then clean and tidy the data as necessary and perform exploratory data analysis including data displays and summaries. We were also encouraged to use statistical methods we had studied in your other modules.

The .html file and the .rmd files are sections of the project that were coded and formatted by me. For brevity and simplicity, the code was hidden in the .html report, but full details of all process inclduing all data cleaning are visible in the .rmd file.
